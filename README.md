## Functionality

On the Left panel we can find 4 main buttons that are 

### 1. Load Registry

What it does it is to open a Windows Registry Hive binary
Files located on  *C:\Windows\System32\Config*
i.e  *System*, *Software* from a Windows PC or VM

You can find this files from differente sources *(IaaS Disk report)*
or tools like https://github.com/Azure/azure-diskinspect-service or the new VM Inspector 
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/vm-inspector-azure-virtual-machines)

### You can explore the Registry tree and move to check the values 

If selected for example in the previous image you can find the Key Entry call Control if you press B you are going to go to BackupRestore key so it's going to look in the subkeys

As well you can use the mouse to move in the Registry Tree explorer

As well you can go to an specific registry with the path 

Just type the Registry key path that you want to go and Press the Blue arrow button

For example in Regedit on windows a path looks like this

*HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp*

Registry Toolbox uses paths like this, please see that the HKLM\System it's not in the path as this File is a System hive so only contains the subcontents so the Paths needs to remove the HLM\System and HLM\Software if this files are loaded

Example of a Valid path 
*ControlSet001\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp*
